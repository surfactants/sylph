# Menu_Save_Game
*class : [Menu](menu.md)*
*ui/menu/menu_save_game.hpp*

## About
Using the encapsulated [Save_List](../elements/save_list.md) object, the player selects a save file which is then overwritten with the current game. A "new" option is also provided, which prompts the player to select a name using a [Dialog](../elements/dialog.md).
