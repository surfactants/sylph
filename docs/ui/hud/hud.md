# HUD
*submodule, class : [UI](../ui.md)*

## About
The HUD is the secondary branch of the UI inheritance tree, serving as a substate machine displaying information during gameplay.

Here is where UI callbacks are defined, for use with game systems such as [Clickable_Tile_System](../../game/system/clickable_tile_system.md).

The only limit is your imagination.
